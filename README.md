# Basic Particle Filter

Part of Robot Mapping Course taught by University of Bonn. Implementation includes the following:

* Sample-based odometry motion model using 
* Resampling step of a particle filter using "roulette wheel" low variance sampling


# Outstanding Questions

* How are target distributions generated from samples?
